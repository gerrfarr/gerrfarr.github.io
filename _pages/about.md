I am a Owen Chamberlain postdoctoral fellow at [Lawrence Berkeley National Lab](https://www.physics.lbl.gov/cosmo/). My work focuses on cosmological data analysis and the large scale structure of the cosmos. In particular I work with observations of the gravitational lensing of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and galaxy surveys. I am a member of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Collabroation and the Simons Observatory (SO) Collaboration where I also currently serve as a member of the Talks Panel.  Furthermore, I am in the process of joining the Dark Engery Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Amongst others I work closely with [Simone Ferraro](https://sferraro.lbl.gov/).

In 2024 I obtained my PhD from the University of Cambridge where I worked with [Blake Sherwin](http://bccp.berkeley.edu/sherwin/) at the [Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/). Before that I graduated with my Bachelor of Science in Physcis from Haverford College in May 2020. At Haverford I worked with [Daniel Grin](http://danielgrin.net/) and [Bruce Partridge](https://www.haverford.edu/users/bpartrid).
